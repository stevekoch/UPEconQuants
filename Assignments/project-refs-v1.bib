  abstract = {Background The National Development Plan (NDP) strives that South Africa, by 2030, in pursuit of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) achieve a significant shift in the equity of health services provision. This paper provides a diagnosis of the extent of socio-economic inequalities in health and healthcare using an integrated conceptual framework. Method The 2012 South African National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (SANHANES-1), a nationally representative study, collected data on a variety of questions related to health and healthcare. A range of concentration indices were calculated for health and healthcare outcomes that fit the various dimensions on the pathway of access. A decomposition analysis was employed to determine how downstream need and access barriers contribute to upstream inequality in healthcare utilisation. Results In terms of healthcare need, good and ill health are concentrated among the socio-economically advantaged and disadvantaged, respectively. The relatively wealthy perceived a greater desire for care than the relatively poor. However, postponement of care seeking and unmet need is concentrated among the socio-economically disadvantaged, as are difficulties with the affordability of healthcare. The socio-economic divide in the utilisation of public and private healthcare services remains stark. Those who are economically disadvantaged are less satisfied with healthcare services. Affordability and ability to pay are the main drivers of inequalities in healthcare utilisation. Conclusion In the South African health system, the socio-economically disadvantaged are discriminated against across the continuum of access. NHI offers a means to enhance ability to pay and to address affordability, while disparities between actual and perceived need warrants investment in health literacy outreach programmes.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT This study estimates progressivity of out-of-pocket (OOP) health payments and their determinants using South African Income and Expenditure Surveys. Concentration is decomposed to examine the effect of household determinants on OOP inequality, shedding light on how progressivity/regressivity is related to changes in the concentration and elasticities of the determinants over time. Our results suggest that actual OOP health expenditures are concentrated among non-poor households, although less so now than in the recent past. When OOP health payments are viewed from the perspective of affordability, which instead focuses on the share of payments relative to capacity-to-pay, they are regressive; However, they have become less concentrated amongst poor households, although still regressive, recently. These results appear to be independent of the measure of socioeconomic status employed in the analysis. The results highlight large income and education-related disparities and also suggest continued gender and ethnic differences that deserve further attention in policymaking.}

abstract = {Abstract Stochastic frontier analysis was used to estimate the technical efficiency of specialist surgeon practices based in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The analysis was conducted for both single and multiple output production functions, while efficiency was allowed to depend upon surgeon and practice characteristics. Multiple output models, due to an increase in the number of observations, can be more precisely estimated and, as there are multiple observations per surgeon, can be estimated with fixed effects. The results of the analyses suggest that efficiency averages around 50\% for this sample and is convex in years of surgical experience. The benefit of multiple output analysis – improved precision – obtains, while surgeon-level fixed effects alleviate some concerns related to unobserved heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {The study sought to analyse the influence of racial differences in the demand for public healthcare in South Africa, using the 2018 General Household Survey (GHS) data. This was completed to understand if race still plays a role in access to healthcare in post-apartheid South Africa. Logistic regression analysis revealed that race significantly explained the variance in demand for public healthcare, with White populations having the lowest probability of demand for public healthcare compared to other races. Consequently, the study noted that racial differences still play a critical role in affording one access to healthcare after assessing the situation obtaining in public healthcare. Therefore, the study recommends that the government of South Africa should create policies that encourage equal access to basic services in addressing racial inequality in the country.}
