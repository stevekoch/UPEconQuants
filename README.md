# UPEconQuants
I am busy developing slides and narrative notes for a quants module at the M level at the University of Pretoria in 
South Africa.

11 Feb 26: I completed the first draft syllabus, but it is an html slides document for presentation purposes. Thus, 
I still need to create a baseline html file that just loads up as an html document.
